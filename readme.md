## **JamPlus**
JamPlus is a simple easy to use language, with very simple commands. It is written in HTML5, JS and CSS, without the help of Node JS or NPM. It is a sequal to Jam, which is written in Node JS, but in order to convert it over to HTML5, I would've needed to done more work than just creating a new version. The site can be found here at: https://JamPlus.mamamia5x.repl.co

### Commands
- startsay
  - The first thing the script says once it starts.

### Rules
This language is set up different than other languages.
- When you want to run a command, the line needs to be just the command name.
- The next line will be the argument, if needed.
  - For example, the first line would be "startsay", then the next line would be what you want the program to say when started.

While being a compiler (more of a parser), the language is also being built onto here. Updates may take longer to happen.
