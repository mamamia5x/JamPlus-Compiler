## **JamPlus**
JamPlus is a simple easy to use language, with very simple commands. It is written in HTML5, JS and CSS, without the help of Node JS or NPM. It is a sequel to Jam, which is written in Node JS, but in order to convert it over to HTML5, I would've needed to done more work than just creating a new version. The site can be found here at:

The Beta Version, which is where I test new features, can be found here at https://JamPlus.mamamia5x.repl.co
